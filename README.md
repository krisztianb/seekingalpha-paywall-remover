# Seeking Alpha Paywall Remover

This is a browser extension that removes the paywall from news and articles on the seekingalpha.com website.

### Examples

The extension only operates on pages similar to the following:

* https://seekingalpha.com/news/4090502-tsmc-q1-earnings-preview-all-eyes-on-the-ai-boom
* https://seekingalpha.com/article/4631605-warner-bros-discovery-have-some-patience

### Installation

Currently only available for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/seeking-alpha-paywall-remover/

### Troubleshooting

If the extension doesn't seem to work for you please try the following before opening an [issue ticket](https://github.com/krisztianb/seekingalpha-paywall-remover/issues):

* Make sure you have the latest version of the extension installed (you can use the URL `about:addons` in Firefox)
* Reload the page while holding down the SHIFT button (= reload ignoring cached content)
* Try reloading the page after the paywall is visible. Repeat this multiple times. It is a known issue that the
  extension often fails to detect the loading of the paywall correctly and therefore can't remove it.
  Until this issue has been fixed please reload the page at least 10 times before reporting a bug. Thanks.
